An old project build back in 2024 as the start of my journey and posted here to preserve my path.

The project only consists of **HTML** + **CSS** and was made as a part of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course.

## 🎨 About the Project

For the upload I only fixed url image attachment to the local one by src.<br>
Even today I like how that page turned out to be visually. Even as a second page I made.<br>
Also the person chosen for the Tribute Page is very significant to me.<br>He was the one who inspared me to continue learning Japanese back then. <br>
I wish I could go to his concert in the future and thank him in person but alas. <br>Rest in peace, Reita 🤍
